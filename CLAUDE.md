# pokit

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues for `kihyun1998/pokit` (via the `gh` CLI). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Comments

A comment says what the code is. Why it is this way, what it deliberately leaves out, the trap and the measured value go to the territory note under `docs/map/`. Where none seems to hold it, search the folder and the code symbol first; only then start a new note, named for what the system does there, not for the file. History goes to the commit message. Comments written before this rule still carry the rest: never delete one whose content the map does not yet hold — move it first (`decant`).

## Layout

- `crates/pokit/` — the CLI and its session.
- `fixtures/app/` — the fixture app the tests drive.
- `crates/tauri-plugin-pokit/` — the plugin an app's test build carries; on macOS pokit reaches the page through it.
